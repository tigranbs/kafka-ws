# About

This project aims to make a simple distribution of Kafka consumer messages over Websocket by giving ability to spread across subscribed channels and data based conditional checking.

# Getting started

To run this project locally you just need Kafka on your environment or just use a provided Docker-Compose file to run project with pre-configured stuff.

Main configuration is inside `src/config.ts`, which is all based on environment variables, so you can just provide it during project run or change default values if you don't know how to change environment variables :)

## TODO: more docs please!
